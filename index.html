        <section class="container">
            <p>Logic, Conditionals, and Loops are some of the most important concepts in all of Software Development. When we work with Loops, 
            we very often are also working with Arrays (or another Data Structure). One of the most common things to do with a loop is to access
            every element of an Array to do <span class="italic">something</span>. Often we want to test a condition (a test) to see determine
            what we will do next in our program.
            <br><br>
            Conditionals:
            <ul id="conditionals" class="things-to-learn">
                <li>if statements</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Test that something is true.</li>
                    <li>Underneath the condition (the test that something is true) there is a block of code that will only execute
                        if that condition (test) is true.
                    </li>
                    <li>if statements can exist on their own, so you may use as many as you like or need.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>else if statements</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Test that something else is true.</li>
                    <li>Only execute when the if statement is false, but another condition is true.</li>
                    <li>Cannot exist on their own.</li>
                    <li>else if statements always come after an if statement, but before the else statement.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>else statements</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not test any condition, so they only use the else keyword.</li>
                    <li>Cannot exist on their own.</li>
                    <li>Every else statement must follow an if statement.</li>
                    <li>Followed by a block of code that will only execute when the condition (test) of the if statement was false.</li>
                </ul>
                </ul>

                Loops
                <ul id="loops" class="things-to-learn">
                    Types of For Loops:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Standard For Loops</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are three statements in a for loop.</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>An index variable declaration that is used to keep track of your place in a loop.</li>
                                <li>A condition that is used to determine when the loop will execute.</li>
                                <li>Incrementing (increasing) your variable by an appropriate amount.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <li>The most flexible kind of loop, since you can loop forwards or backwards.</li>
                            <li>Exists in all programming languages</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>For/Of Loops</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designed as an easy way to loop through anything that can be iterated (string, array, list, etc).</li>
                            <li>Requires you to create an index variable inside the loop declaration.</li>
                            <li>Handles looping for you.</li>
                            <li>Easy syntax, but less flexible than a standard for loop.</li>
                            <li>Can only loop in one direction (start to end).</li>
                            <li>Can only iterate by one.</li>
                            <li>Many languages have a version of this, but not all languages support for/of loops specifically.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>For/In Loops</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designed specifically to loop through the properties of an Object.</li>
                            <li>Excellent for working with objects, but not well suited to looping over other things.</li>
                            <li>Requires you to declare an index variable (like for/of loops do) to keep track of your place in the loop.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    Types of While Loops:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Standard While Loops</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continues executing a block of code <span class="italic">while</span> a condition is true.</li>
                            <li>Requires you to declare an index variable outside of the loop and its declaration.</li>
                            <li>Requires you to increase the index inside the block of code.</li>
                            <li>Less forgiving than for loops, since you must iterate your index variable.</li>
                            <li>Forgetting to iterate your index variable will cause an <span class="italic">infinite loop</span> that will crash
                                your browser.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Do/While Loops</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Works exactly like a Standard While Loop, but it will always execute a single time regardless of whether or not
                                the condition is true.
                            </li>
                            <li>Declared using the do keyword.</li>
                            <li>The condition only comes after the block of code to execute.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
